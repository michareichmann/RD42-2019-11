	\begin{itemize}\itemfill
		\item ROC = Plane
		\item resolution = width of the residual distribution at the plane under test
		\item can achieve \SI{\sim20}{\micro\meter} resolution at very low $\upchi^2$
		\item resolution at the front slightly better than in the back
		\begin{itemize}
			\item less multiple scattering
		\end{itemize}
% 		\item choose \SI{90}{\%} quantile to have a large number of events

	\end{itemize}

	\begin{itemize}\itemfill
		\item<1-> every point the mean of a whole rate scan
		\item<1-> very high points have no attenuator
		\item<1-> first two points have a change in amplifier
		\item<2-> most points very stable over time but some fluctuate (maybe DRS4 issue)
		\item<3-> standard deviation in general below \SI{.5}{\%}

\begin{frame}{B2 Rate Scans}

	\begin{minipage}[c][.7\textheight]{.34\textwidth}
		\begin{itemize}\itemfill
			\item after irradiation pulse height is very stable
			\item maximum irradiation: \SI{8e15}{\ncm}
			\item little drop for high rates at high irradiations 
			\item \ra due to decreasing signals one cut is working less efficient
			\item<2> positive and negative bias agree very well

	\begin{itemize}\itemfill
		\item less than \SI{20}{\%} of the tested diamonds show rate dependence \SI{>10}{\%}
		\item very large rate dependence at the first measurement (\SI{>90}{\%})
		\item after reprocessing and surface cleaning with RIE very stable behaviour (\SI{\sim2}{\%})
		\item feasible to ``fix'' bad diamonds
