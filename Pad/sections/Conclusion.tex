		\begin{itemize}\itemfill
			\item all the data we took with the digital ETH Telescope at PSI was analysed
			\begin{itemize}
				\item needs to be fully checked
			\end{itemize}
			\item most important results are available on the website
			\item improved and sped up alignment procedure
			\item iteratively adjust errors of the individual planes to fix $\chi^2$-distribution
			\item improved integration procedure of the waveforms
			\item scCVD diamond is stable over the year 
			\begin{itemize}
				\item mean pulse height of the rate scans stays constant
				\item standard deviation of the rate scans in general \SI{<.5}{\%}
			\end{itemize}
			\item irradiated pCVD diamond does not show dependence on rate to \orderof{\SI{2}{\%}} up to \SI{20}{\mhzcm}
			\item possible to fix diamonds that show rate dependence due to surface issues
		\end{itemize}
