	\begin{itemize}\itemfill
		\item after large radiation fluence all detectors become trap limited
		\item bias and readout electrode inside detector material
		\item same thickness $D$ \ra same amount of induced charge \ra shorter drift distance $L$
		\item \good{increase collected charge in detectors with limited mean drift path (Schubweg)}

	\begin{itemize}\itemfill
		\item electrodes (columns) drilled with femto-second laser
		\item connection to bias and readout with surface metallisation
		\item ganging of cells to match pixel pitch of readout-chip (ROC)
		\item small gap (\SI{\sim15}{\micro\meter}) to the surface to avoid a high voltage break-through
